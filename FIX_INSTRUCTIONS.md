To fix the 'Cannot find module 'multer'' error, please follow these steps:

1.  Open a terminal in the project's root directory.
2.  Run the command `npm install` to install the missing dependencies that have been added to `package.json`.
3.  Navigate to the `server` directory with `cd server`.
4.  Run the server with `node server.js`.

This should resolve the error and start the server.
